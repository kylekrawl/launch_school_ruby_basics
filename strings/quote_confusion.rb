# Modify the following code so that double-quotes are used 
# instead of single-quotes.
#
# puts 'It\'s now 12 o\'clock.'
#
# Expected output:
#
# It's now 12 o'clock.
#
# Solution:

puts "It's now 12 o'clock."

# Further Exploration
#
# What about strings that contain double- and single-
# quotes? How would you write those using the alternate 
# syntax?

# Solution:
#
# puts %q(string with "double quotes" and 'single quotes')
